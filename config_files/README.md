The parameters appearing in the config files can be grouped as 
  - General parameters that are needed for any SPB executable, and 
  - Parameters that are specific to different stages of modeling.

Details of parameters are documented in the config files.   
Note that each SPB executable has a config file in its own directory.  
Config files for production code (used in the actual modeling) have been separated from those for test runs.

## General parameters (applicable for all SPB executables)
These are found under:
  - 

## Sampling-specific parameters 
  - **b**


## Analysis-specific parameters

## Clustering-specific parameters

## Density map-specific parameters
