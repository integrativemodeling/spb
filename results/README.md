The folders in this directory correspond to models obtained in initial and final modeling runs (refer to the paper for what these mean). 
They are organized by clusters, numbered according to the paper.

Each cluster contains:

    - **top_scoring_model.rmf** : Top scoring model representing the cluster, can be visualized using UCSF Chimera. 
      To color the model according to the paper use `scripts/chimera/color_model_chimera_commands.txt` . 
      Load it as a Chimera commands file after loading the model on Chimera.
